	<p>Hi! I'm Blizzard, but my family has a load of nick names for me!! I'm a yellow lab!</p>
		<img src="Blitz.jpg">
	<p>Here's a picture of me getting rubbed my sister!</p>
	<p>I have a wonderful family!!
		<ul>
			<li>My sister, Anna, is the most loving person. She takes me on walks, pets me till I get annoyed, and lets me sleep in her bed! She's in college so I don't get to see her as much as I would like, but she's still my best friend! </li>

			<li>My brother, Anmol, isn't as big on showing affection. But I know he loves me becuase he sits and talks to me every day.</li>

			<li>My Daddy, Venu, is the one who trained me. Every time he pets me its like getting a much needed massage</li>

			<li>My mom, Sandy, is my favorite person in the world. She not only feeds me kibble like all the other dogs, but whenever she makes human food I get some too!</li>
		</ul>
